## Note :And in this project i used Fabric.js instead of react-canvas-draw. it is good library  but its docs are very hard to find out  for extracting the drawing i struggle very much . And as you mentioned backend using fast api, first thing i am not familiar with fastApi becuase i am using node express from last one as my first backend framework   thats why i am skilled in it.

## Thanks for considering my Application 🙏
